# 🚀 Vibe Code Crew | StarIAup

[🇧🇷 Português](readme.md) | [🇺🇸 English](readme.en.md)

**AI-Guided Software Development, Human-Structured.**

This repository contains the **Specialized Agent Crew** for the Vibe Code methodology, developed by StarIAup. A revolutionary approach that combines the power of generative AI with rigorous software engineering processes to **minimize token costs, eliminate rework, and deliver quality products**.

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Traditional Vibe Coding** is expensive and chaotic:
- Thousands of tokens wasted on re-executions
- Lack of technical hierarchy generates inconsistent code
- Outdated documentation causes AI hallucinations
- Absence of automated QA results in production bugs

**Our Solution:** A crew of 8 specialized agents with clear hierarchy, documentation as "Single Source of Truth," and automated validation at every step.

---

## 👥 The Crew

### Strategy Layer
- **01 - Gabriel (Orchestrator):** Initiates projects, maintains the `STATE.md`, configures repositories, and sets the stage.
- **02 - Ricardo (PM):** Defines the product. Creates PRDs, Epics, User Stories, and manages the `ROADMAP.md`.
- **03 - Sofia (CTO):** Supreme technical authority. Defines architecture, data inventory, and RLS.

### Design Layer
- **04 - Beatriz (Brand):** Guardian of visual identity. Creates Design System and Brand Book.
- **05 - Pamela (Copy):** Voice of the product. Defines tone, microcopy, and messaging.
- **06 - Amanda (UI/UX):** Visual translator. Creates frontend specs and page workflows.

### Execution Layer
- **07 - Helena (Prompt Engineer):** AI maestro. Transforms requirements into surgical PRPs (using XML-structured prompts for precision).

> **Note:** Implementation agents (Marcos and Claudio) have been retired. Code execution is now performed directly by code agents like Antigravity/Gemini, which consume the documents generated by the crew.

### Quality Layer
- **08 - Paulo (QA Auto):** Automated Devil's Advocate. Validates with Browser Testing (Playwright).

## 🛠 How to Use

### 1. Start a Project
Invoke **Gabriel** with your idea. He will create the `project_brief.md`.

### 2. Define Product
**Ricardo** transforms the briefing into PRD, Epics, and User Stories.

### 3. Architecture and Design
**Sofia** defines the technical structure. **Beatriz** and **Pamela** define identity. **Amanda** designs the screens.

### 4. Execution
**Helena** creates the PRPs. Code agents (Antigravity/Gemini) implement strictly following Sofia's architecture and the generated documentation.

### 5. Validation
**Paulo** executes automated tests against the User Stories' acceptance criteria.

## ⚡ GSD Protocol Integration



To maximize efficiency and minimize "context drift" (when AI loses focus due to long conversations), the Crew adopts the **Get Shit Done (GSD)** protocol:



1.  **Atomic Contexts:** Code agents must work in fresh, isolated sessions for each task. No long conversation histories.

2.  **Living State (`STATE.md`):** Gabriel maintains a living document tracking the project's pulse, context, and active phase, ensuring no agent works with outdated information.

3.  **Brownfield Mapping:** For existing projects, Sofia executes a "Reconnaissance" protocol to map `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` before any code is touched.

4.  **Atomic Commits:** Every single task completed by the code agent results in an isolated, verifiable git commit.



---



## 🎓 Core Principles



1.  **Technical Hierarchy:** Sofia is the authority. Code agents obey without deviation.

2.  **Single Source of Truth:** The Database Inventory is the only source of truth about data. `STATE.md` is the source of truth for progress.

3.  **Documentation as Code:** Outdated documentation = broken code.

4.  **QA Driven:** Acceptance criteria are defined BEFORE code is written.

5.  **Vibe Manifesto:** Each agent has personality and executes internal monologue before acting.

6.  **Fresh Contexts:** Never feed an execution agent the entire history. Feed them the Plan + Context + Standards.

## 🙏 Credits



This methodology didn't emerge from nowhere. It's the result of **consuming, adapting, and versioning** the work of giants who came before:



### Fundamental Influences (~65-78% of the structure)



**[GlitterCowboy (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)**  

The GSD system provided the protocols for **Context Engineering** and **Atomic Execution**. The idea of breaking plans into XML-structured tasks and executing them in fresh "subagent" windows to avoid token waste and hallucinations is central to our Execution Layer.



**[Brian (BMAD Method)](https://github.com/bmadcode)**  

The concept of **agentic construction** with AI comes directly from BMAD. Versioning development by stages with specific "personas" and their own execution steps is the foundation of the methodology.



**[Deborah Folloni (DebGPT)](https://x.com/dfolloni)**  

Deborah, with all her free content on YouTube, was indirectly responsible for more than half of the methodology's fundamental principles. How each file should be structured, the KISS, DRY, SOLID concepts, among others, were learned from her content.

### Our Contribution

We extracted and adapted the main concepts from DebGPT and BMAD methodologies to create a methodology that is viable for Vibe Coding. Objectively, we translated what made the most sense to us and implemented:

- Rigid technical hierarchy (Sofia as authority)
- QA Auto specialization (Paulo with Browser Testing)
- Structured templates for Epics and User Stories
- Distributed validation flow (dependency_validation)
- Visible Step Zero (forced personification)

**Result:** A methodology that respects its roots but evolves to solve real problems of cost and quality in Vibe Coding.

## 📄 License

Long live **open source** and shared knowledge. We accept honorable mentions, but between us, what matters is learning and evolving together. **Use freely.**

Files may undergo constant changes and evolutions.
