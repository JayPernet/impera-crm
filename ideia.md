Impera CRM It's a CRM for small and medium-sized real estate agencies, and for independent brokers. The proposition is very simple: a single place to not only manage leads/clients but also to manage properties and open up opportunities for one of StarIAup's products: an AI agent for customer service. This AI agent will have a direct connection to the CRM, thus facilitating processes and management. The CRM is multi-tenant, with different roles for access and privileges. I, from StarIAup, am the admin; the owner(s) of the real estate agency are the managers, and the brokers of the respective agencies are also managers.
